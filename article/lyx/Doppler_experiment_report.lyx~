,the experiment intends to illustrate the Doppler shift effect under uniform
 circular motion .This project has the goal of illustating the the effect
 under different scenarios.
 Therefore couple of different experiments were performed,which were processed
 and are it's findings are presented in this article.Those experiments were
 performed as part of the course

 which took place during the second semester in the second year in the undergrad
uate program for the computer engineering in the Hebrew university of Jerusalem.
 The idea for this project was based on the final project of a couple of
 Physics graduates that was done in the Worcester Polytechnic Institute

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When our group first heard about an experiment that illustrates the Doppler
 effect by spinning a buzzer using a motor,we were intrigued and wondered
 if this experiment would work or not.
 In fact, it works because when the source moves in a circle,an approaching
 and receding velocity is perceived by an observer.Therfore when placing
 a microphone next to the buzzer the doppler shift is not percieved.

\begin_layout Standard
For a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

\begin_layout Standard
By Substituting this equation to

Experimental System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to perform our experiment,the system that is shown in Fig.
 1 was set up.
 A Brushless motor 
\begin_inset Formula $(a)$
\end_inset

 controlled with an a Arduino Mega 
\begin_inset Formula $(b)$
\end_inset

 was set.Brushles motor is a type of an electric motor that is considered
 to be quiet.This feature comes in handy as we wanted to minimize the effect
 of any cause that can increase the bias erros in our experiment.Also as
 the Brushless motor cannot be directly controlled with an Arduino ,an electonic
 speed controlled(ESC) 
\begin_inset Formula $(c)$
\end_inset

 was attached to the motor from one end and both an Arduino and a LiPO 
\begin_inset Formula $(d)$
\end_inset

 battry on the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LiPO was placed as the voltage requierments for the motor are far greater
 then what the Arduino is capable of providing.Besides,A wooden bar 
\begin_inset Formula $(e)$
\end_inset

 was placed on 
\color white
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
\color inherit
the top of the motor.On the edge of this bar a buzzer
\begin_inset Formula $(f)$
\end_inset

 and a battry 
\begin_inset Formula $(g)$
\end_inset

 were placed.The bar was set to spin at a constant angular speed and the
 sound it emitted was recoreded.The sound was captured as .wav file using
 a microphone
\begin_inset Formula $(i)$
\end_inset

.The .wav file was then analyzed in a spectrogram software program .The software
 used in our experiment is available on the web

.It displayed the audio signal as a frequency-versus-time plot.Also, as the
 program allows displaying, a continuous readout of time (ms), frequency
 (Hz), and signal level (dB) at the position of the mouse pointer (cursor)
 it because relatively simple to sample those frequencies.

During the course of the semester, we had a lot of problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to solve in relatively short period of time.Thankfully, we had
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
plenty of help from our lab supervisor Amit Kessel who helped us
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
setting up the equipment.We were given
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
complete control on the design and manufacture of
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the Doppler device.However,the motor that was
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
bought was proven to be too powerfull and the
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
inital wooden construction could not stand the force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which the rotaing arm expelled and the entire construction fell apart.Amit
 helped us
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
create a new sturdier design and contact the workshop in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
our university which built it for us.
