hen I first heard about an experiment that illustrates the Doppler effect
 by twirling a buzzer around one’s head,1 I was intrigued and wondered if
 this experiment would work or not.
 In fact, it works because you usually do not place both ears exactly in
 the center of the circle; this would be very difficult indeed.
 When the source moves in a circle, the distance from the center is always
 constant, and there is no approaching or receding velocity at all.
 Holding a microphone in the same hand that holds the string that is attached
 to the buzzer easily shows this simple fact.
 No Doppler effect is observed.
 Although several qualitative demonstrations and experiments of the Doppler
 effect have been published,1,2 only a very few quantitative experiments
 are found in the literature.3 Having devised a new method to quantify the
 Doppler effect, described in a previous article,4 we thought it would be
 a good physics and geometry exercise to calculate and measure the frequency
 variations when the microphone is placed on the circular path of the buzzer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to perform our experiment,the system that is shown in Fig.
 1 is set up.
 A brushless motor controlled by a Arduino mega was set.Between the motor
 and the Ardunio a ESC and a LiPO battery was placed.Also a 60[cm] wooden
 bar is put on the motor.
 On this bar a a buzzer connected to a 3-V battery are fixed.
 The bar is set to spin at a constant angular speed and the sound is recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sound of the buzzer at rest must also be recorded as a reference.The
 sound is captured as a .wav file using a microphone connected to the “line
 in” computer’s soundboard, available in most computers.
 The .wav file is then analyzed in a spectrogram software program.
 The software used in our study is available on the web.5 It displays the
 audio signal as a frequency-versus-time plot with signal amplitude at each
 frequency represented by intensity (or color).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, a continuous readout of time (ms), frequency (
\begin_inset Formula $Hz$
\end_inset

), and signal level (
\begin_inset Formula $dB$
\end_inset

) at the position of the mouse pointer (cursor) allows an easy sampling
 of the frequencies with maximum signal level.
 Figure 2 shows a typical display given by the spectrogram software.
 The recorded frequency of the buzzer increases to its maximum value when
 it approaches the microphone (maximum approaching speed).
 And it is abruptly decreased to its minimum just after the buzzer passes
 over the microphone (maximum receding speed).
 When the buzzer is located opposite to the microphone, there is no movement
 towards or away from it.
 Therefore, the recorded frequency (
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

) is the same as that produced by the buzzer at rest (
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

).

Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the receding/approaching velocity be 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}$
\end_inset

.
 It will be positive if the buzzer is receding and negative if it is approaching
 the microphone.
 If the observer (microphone) is at rest, the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

 will be given by the well-known Doppler effect equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $f=f_{0}(\frac{v_{s}}{v_{s}+D})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the sound velocity.
 In order to find 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}$
\end_inset

 as a function of time, one needs to make some geometrical considerations
 based on Fig.
 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}=Vcos$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 the tangential velocity of the buzzer and the angle between 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}$
\end_inset

.
 If T is the period of rotation of the buzzer and R the radius of the circle,
 then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $V=\frac{\text{2\pi R}}{T}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which gives :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}=\frac{2\pi cos\gamma}{T}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observing the angles in Fig.
 3 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta+2\alpha=\pi/2$
\end_inset

.
 Solving for we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\theta/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $V,\theta=2\pi\text{t/T}$
\end_inset

, which makes 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

t/T .
 Direct substitution into Eq.
 (2) yields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $V_{D}=\frac{2\pi R}{T}cos(\frac{\pi t}{T}),$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Substituting this expression into Eq.
 (1) gives the final equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $f=f_{0}[\frac{v_{s}}{v_{s}+\frac{2\pi R}{T}cos(\frac{\pi t}{T})}]$
\end_inset

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can determine T dividing the time of 10 revolutions by 10 or looking
 directly at the spectrogram to find the time between two consecutive peak
 frequencies in Fig.
 2.
 From the spectrogram of the buzzer at rest, we can find f0.
 Varying t from 0 to T for two revolutions, we superimposed the theoretical
 Eq.
 (4) on the experimental data taken from the spectrogram (see Fig.
 4).
 The solid line in the figure is the theoretical curve Eq.
 (4).
 The data points are represented by small squares and the error bars are
 also shown.
 Experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment presented here provides nice additions to the standard study
 of the Doppler effect in a straight-line movement.4 We found that, apart
 from having a good chance of applying more geometry and trigonometry to
 physics, this relatively simple experiment gives a deeper understanding
 of the Doppler effect.
 This was very clearly observed when we saw that the students could tell
 the position of the buzzer in each moment of the frequency-versus-time
 graph (Fig.
 4).
